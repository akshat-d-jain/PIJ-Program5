# PIJ-Program5
# Menu-Driven Shape Calculator

## Introduction
This Java program allows users to calculate the area and volume of various shapes through a menu-driven interface. It includes implementations for shapes such as Circle, Rectangle, Square, Sphere, Cylinder, and Pyramid.

## Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Select a shape from the menu.
2. Input the required measurements for the selected shape.
3. The program will calculate and display the area and volume of the shape.

## Instructions
1. Compile the Java files.
2. Run the Main class.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to calculate the area and volume of shapes.
